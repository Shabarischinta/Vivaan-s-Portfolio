It it the 4th movie in the Star Wars series and is about a cruel Empire ruling the galaxy, who are building a Death Star, which has the power to destroy planets.

		<h1> My Favourite Video Games </h1>
		<p>  My favourite video game is Fortnite. It is a extremely fun shooter game with a unique mix of fun and action. It's colourful graphics and creative building mechanics set it apart from other battle royales, like Pubg of COD. There are endless strategies to try while battling opponents, which means there is always ways to improve. Fortnite also keeps things exciting with constant updates, new seasons, special events and competetive games where you can earn money ranging from $100 - $3 million. Plus, I can customise my character with cool skins and items, adding a new touch to every match!   </p>

		<h1> Countries I Have Visited </h1>
		<p>  The countries that I have visited are: Scotland, Wales, France, Switzerland, Germany, Czechia and Turkey. Switzerland was my favourite holiday because there was a beautiful mix of nature and historic buildings and the people there were very friendly to my family. One famous mountain that we saw the view from was Jungfrau, Interlaken. Jungfrau is one of the majestic Three Peaks of Interlaken. There is also a pier with a beautiful view that is the place from a scene in a K-drama: Crash Landing on You.   </p>
